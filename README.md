# HackNRoll-KELIX

## Telegram Bot

## About Us and Vision
Hello! We are KELIX, a passionate team that is participating in HackNRoll. We have built a Telegram bot called IceAxe to empower students to effortlessly break the ice and forge meaningful connections through shared topics and engaging interactions.

## Built Using:
- Supabase (database)

## Problem Statement
Individuals often struggle to initiate and sustain meaningful conversations in group settings due to a lack of common topics and social confidence, leading to missed opportunities for connection. IceAxe aims to tackle this by enhancing their orientation experience by involving them in active discussions about various controversial topics and fun facts about themselves.

### Key Feature
IceAxe consolidates interesting facts among the group members and releases a random fact about a random member each time. After which, a poll will be created for them to guess the member.

### Steps to set up
1. Admin will create a group chat with all the members
