# HackNRoll-KELIX

## Telegram Bot

## About Us and Vision
Hello! We are KELIX, a passionate team that is participating in HackNRoll. We have built a Telegram bot called IceAxe to empower students to effortlessly break the ice and forge meaningful connections through shared topics and engaging interactions.

## Built Using:
1. Python
2. Supabase (database)

## Problem Statement
Students often struggle to initiate and sustain meaningful conversations in group settings due to a lack of common topics and social confidence, leading to missed opportunities for connection. IceAxe aims to tackle this by enhancing their orientation experience by involving them in active discussions about various controversial topics and fun facts about themselves.

### Key Feature
1. Never Have I Ever - Each member begins with 10 points. For every "yes" answer to a question posted by the bot, one point is deducted from their total. This process continues until a winner is determined based on who still has points remaining or who loses all their points last.
2. Building Bridges - The bot selects one member to answer a question (e.g., "Who looks the smartest here?") by choosing the person they believe fits the description best. Following this, the bot issues a challenge for both members to compete against each other. The winner of the challenge gains the power to either hide or reveal the question that was originally asked.
3. GuessWho - As part of the registration process, members are required to answer a set of questions. The bot will then randomly share one of the responses from a student in the group chat, allowing everyone to guess and discuss who they think the answer belongs to.
4. Controversial - The bot will present a controversial question and create a poll for members to choose a side. Once the poll is complete, members can engage in discussions to share their thoughts and debate each other's choices, fostering deeper conversations and interactions.

### Steps to set up
