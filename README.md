## [Telegram Bot](https://t.me/IceAxe_bot)

## About Us and Vision
Hello! We are KELIX, a passionate team that is participating in HackNRoll. We have built a Telegram bot called IceAxe to empower students to effortlessly break the ice and forge meaningful connections through shared topics and engaging interactions.

## Built Using:
1. Python
2. Supabase (database)
3. Bot Father

## Problem Statement
Students often struggle to initiate and sustain meaningful conversations in group settings due to a lack of common topics and social confidence, leading to missed opportunities for connection. IceAxe aims to tackle this by enhancing their orientation experience by involving them in active discussions about various controversial topics and fun facts about themselves.

### Key Feature
1. Never Have I Ever - Each member begins with 10 points. For every "yes" answer to a question posted by the bot, one point is deducted from their total. This process continues until a winner is determined based on who still has points remaining or who loses all their points last.
2. GuessWho - As part of the registration process, members are required to answer a set of questions. The bot will then randomly share one of the responses from a student in the group chat, allowing everyone to guess and discuss who they think the answer belongs to.
3. Controversial - The bot will present a controversial question and create a poll for members to choose a side. Once the poll is complete, members can engage in discussions to share their thoughts and debate each other's choices, fostering deeper conversations and interactions.

### Steps to set up
1. The admin will set up a group chat with all members and include the Telegram bot in the group.
2. Each member will create their individual profile by responding to a few questions about themselves.
3. To initialise the group, members will use the /init command, and others can join by clicking the join button.
4. Once the group is set up, anyone in the chat can start a game by using the /startgame command and selecting one of the available options.
5. Follow the bot's instructions and enjoy playing the game together!
